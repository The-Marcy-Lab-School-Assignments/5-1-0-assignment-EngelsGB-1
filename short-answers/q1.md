# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Instance methods and properties are created within the class definition. On the other hand, class methods and properties are created with the static keyword and can only be used by the class itself and not by its instances.
Example:

```js
class Example {
  static class = "I'm a class property.";
  constructor(arg) {
    this.prop = arg;
  }
  instanceMethod() {
    console.log("I'm an instance method.");
  }
  static classMethod() {
    console.log("I'm a class method.");
  }
}
const oneExample = new Example("I'm an instance property.");
console.log(oneExample.prop); // logs "I'm an instance property."
console.log(oneExample.class); // logs "undefined"
console.log(Example.class); // logs "I'm a class property."
oneExample.instanceMethod(); // logs "I'm an instance method."
Example.classMethod(); // logs "I'm a class method."
```
